                                Coriolanus Snow and the root causes of his villainous behavior. Collins once again proves
                                that she is a master of building a fascinating world around complex characters who must
                                grapple with the complications of chaos and control and their effects on human nature."

She is a folk singer of prophetic ballads and has a thing about snakes. She is gorgeous, of course, in her late mother's old rainbow dress (the casting for the film, confirmed by Lionsgate, will be fun)."
